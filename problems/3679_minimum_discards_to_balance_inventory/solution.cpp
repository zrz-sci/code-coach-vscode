 * LeetCode Problem 3679:  Minimum Discards to Balance Inventory
 * Difficulty: Medium
 * Tags: Array, Hash Table, Counting, Sliding Window, Simulation
 *
 * Problem Description:
 * You are given two integers `w` and `m`, and an integer array `arrivals`,
 * where
 * `arrivals[i]` is the type of item arriving on day `i` (days are
 * **1-indexed**).
 * 
 * Items are managed according to the following rules:
 * 
 * * Each arrival may be **kept** or **discarded** ; an item may only be
 * discarded on its arrival day.
 * * For each day `i`, consider the window of days `[max(1, i - w + 1), i]`
 * (the `w` most recent days up to day `i`):
 * * For **any** such window, each item type may appear **at most** `m` times
 * among kept arrivals whose arrival day lies in that window.
 * * If keeping the arrival on day `i` would cause its type to appear **more
 * than** `m` times in the window, that arrival **must** be discarded.
 * 
 * Return the **minimum** number of arrivals to be discarded so that every
 * `w`-day
 * window contains at most `m` occurrences of each type.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * **Example 1:**
 * 
 * **Input:** arrivals = [1,2,1,3,1], w = 4, m = 2
 * 
 * **Output:** 0
 * 
 * **Explanation:**
 * 
 * * On day 1, Item 1 arrives; the window contains no more than `m`
 * occurrences of this type, so we keep it.
 *   * On day 2, Item 2 arrives; the window of days 1 - 2 is fine.
 * * On day 3, Item 1 arrives, window `[1, 2, 1]` has item 1 twice, within
 * limit.
 * * On day 4, Item 3 arrives, window `[1, 2, 1, 3]` has item 1 twice,
 * allowed.
 * * On day 5, Item 1 arrives, window `[2, 1, 3, 1]` has item 1 twice, still
 * valid.
 * 
 * There are no discarded items, so return 0.
 * 
 * **Example 2:**
 * 
 * **Input:** arrivals = [1,2,3,3,3,4], w = 3, m = 2
 * 
 * **Output:** 1
 * 
 * **Explanation:**
 * 
 *   * On day 1, Item 1 arrives. We keep it.
 *   * On day 2, Item 2 arrives, window `[1, 2]` is fine.
 *   * On day 3, Item 3 arrives, window `[1, 2, 3]` has item 3 once.
 *   * On day 4, Item 3 arrives, window `[2, 3, 3]` has item 3 twice, allowed.
 * * On day 5, Item 3 arrives, window `[3, 3, 3]` has item 3 three times,
 * exceeds limit, so the arrival must be discarded.
 *   * On day 6, Item 4 arrives, window `[3, 4]` is fine.
 * 
 * Item 3 on day 5 is discarded, and this is the minimum number of arrivals to
 * discard, so return 1.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * **Constraints:**
 * 
 *   * `1 <= arrivals.length <= 105`
 *   * `1 <= arrivals[i] <= 105`
 *   * `1 <= w <= arrivals.length`
 *   * `1 <= m <= w`
 *
