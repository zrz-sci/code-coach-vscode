 * LeetCode Problem 289: Game of Life
 * Difficulty: Medium
 * Tags: Array, Matrix, Simulation
 *
 * Problem Description:
 * According to [Wikipedia's
 * article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life): "The
 * **Game of
 * Life** , also known simply as **Life** , is a cellular automaton devised by
 * the
 * British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970."
 * 
 * The board is made up of an `m x n` grid of cells, where each cell has an
 * initial
 * state: **live** (represented by a `1`) or **dead** (represented by a `0`).
 * Each
 * cell interacts with its [eight
 * neighbors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore_neighborhood) (horizontal,
 * vertical, diagonal) using the following four rules (taken from the above
 * Wikipedia article):
 * 
 * 1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies as if caused by
 * under-population.
 * 2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next
 * generation.
 * 3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by
 * over-population.
 * 4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as
 * if by reproduction.
 * 
 * The next state of the board is determined by applying the above rules
 * simultaneously to every cell in the current state of the `m x n` grid
 * `board`.
 * In this process, births and deaths occur **simultaneously**.
 * 
 * Given the current state of the `board`, **update** the `board` to reflect
 * its
 * next state.
 * 
 * **Note** that you do not need to return anything.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * **Example 1:**
 * 
 *     
 *     
 *     **Input:** board = [[0,1,0],[0,0,1],[1,1,1],[0,0,0]]
 *     **Output:** [[0,0,0],[1,0,1],[0,1,1],[0,1,0]]
 *     
 * 
 * **Example 2:**
 * 
 *     
 *     
 *     **Input:** board = [[1,1],[1,0]]
 *     **Output:** [[1,1],[1,1]]
 *     
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * **Constraints:**
 * 
 *   * `m == board.length`
 *   * `n == board[i].length`
 *   * `1 <= m, n <= 25`
 *   * `board[i][j]` is `0` or `1`.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * **Follow up:**
 * 
 * * Could you solve it in-place? Remember that the board needs to be updated
 * simultaneously: You cannot update some cells first and then use their
 * updated values to update other cells.
 * * In this question, we represent the board using a 2D array. In principle,
 * the board is infinite, which would cause problems when the active area
 * encroaches upon the border of the array (i.e., live cells reach the border).
 * How would you address these problems?
 *
