 * LeetCode Problem 2188: Minimum Time to Finish the Race
 * Difficulty: Hard
 * Tags: Array, Dynamic Programming
 *
 * Problem Description:
 * You are given a **0-indexed** 2D integer array `tires` where `tires[i] =
 * [fi,
 * ri]` indicates that the `ith` tire can finish its `xth` successive lap in
 * `fi *
 * ri(x-1)` seconds.
 * 
 * * For example, if `fi = 3` and `ri = 2`, then the tire would finish its
 * `1st` lap in `3` seconds, its `2nd` lap in `3 * 2 = 6` seconds, its `3rd`
 * lap in `3 * 22 = 12` seconds, etc.
 * 
 * You are also given an integer `changeTime` and an integer `numLaps`.
 * 
 * The race consists of `numLaps` laps and you may start the race with **any**
 * tire. You have an **unlimited** supply of each tire and after every lap,
 * you may
 * **change** to any given tire (including the current tire type) if you wait
 * `changeTime` seconds.
 * 
 * Return _the**minimum** time to finish the race._
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * **Example 1:**
 * 
 *     
 *     
 *     **Input:** tires = [[2,3],[3,4]], changeTime = 5, numLaps = 4
 *     **Output:** 21
 *     **Explanation:** 
 *     Lap 1: Start with tire 0 and finish the lap in 2 seconds.
 *     Lap 2: Continue with tire 0 and finish the lap in 2 * 3 = 6 seconds.
 * Lap 3: Change tires to a new tire 0 for 5 seconds and then finish the lap
 * in another 2 seconds.
 *     Lap 4: Continue with tire 0 and finish the lap in 2 * 3 = 6 seconds.
 *     Total time = 2 + 6 + 5 + 2 + 6 = 21 seconds.
 *     The minimum time to complete the race is 21 seconds.
 *     
 * 
 * **Example 2:**
 * 
 *     
 *     
 *     **Input:** tires = [[1,10],[2,2],[3,4]], changeTime = 6, numLaps = 5
 *     **Output:** 25
 *     **Explanation:** 
 *     Lap 1: Start with tire 1 and finish the lap in 2 seconds.
 *     Lap 2: Continue with tire 1 and finish the lap in 2 * 2 = 4 seconds.
 * Lap 3: Change tires to a new tire 1 for 6 seconds and then finish the lap
 * in another 2 seconds.
 *     Lap 4: Continue with tire 1 and finish the lap in 2 * 2 = 4 seconds.
 * Lap 5: Change tires to tire 0 for 6 seconds then finish the lap in another
 * 1 second.
 *     Total time = 2 + 4 + 6 + 2 + 4 + 6 + 1 = 25 seconds.
 *     The minimum time to complete the race is 25 seconds. 
 *     
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * **Constraints:**
 * 
 *   * `1 <= tires.length <= 105`
 *   * `tires[i].length == 2`
 *   * `1 <= fi, changeTime <= 105`
 *   * `2 <= ri <= 105`
 *   * `1 <= numLaps <= 1000`
 *
