 * LeetCode Problem 3296: Minimum Number of Seconds to Make Mountain Height Zero
 * Difficulty: Medium
 * Tags: Greedy, Array, Math, Binary Search, Heap (Priority Queue)
 *
 * Problem Description:
 * You are given an integer `mountainHeight` denoting the height of a mountain.
 * 
 * You are also given an integer array `workerTimes` representing the work
 * time of
 * workers in **seconds**.
 * 
 * The workers work **simultaneously** to **reduce** the height of the
 * mountain.
 * For worker `i`:
 * 
 * * To decrease the mountain's height by `x`, it takes `workerTimes[i] +
 * workerTimes[i] * 2 + ... + workerTimes[i] * x` seconds. For example:
 * * To reduce the height of the mountain by 1, it takes `workerTimes[i]`
 * seconds.
 * * To reduce the height of the mountain by 2, it takes `workerTimes[i] +
 * workerTimes[i] * 2` seconds, and so on.
 * 
 * Return an integer representing the **minimum** number of seconds required
 * for
 * the workers to make the height of the mountain 0.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * **Example 1:**
 * 
 * **Input:** mountainHeight = 4, workerTimes = [2,1,1]
 * 
 * **Output:** 3
 * 
 * **Explanation:**
 * 
 * One way the height of the mountain can be reduced to 0 is:
 * 
 *   * Worker 0 reduces the height by 1, taking `workerTimes[0] = 2` seconds.
 * * Worker 1 reduces the height by 2, taking `workerTimes[1] + workerTimes[1]
 * * 2 = 3` seconds.
 *   * Worker 2 reduces the height by 1, taking `workerTimes[2] = 1` second.
 * 
 * Since they work simultaneously, the minimum time needed is `max(2, 3, 1) =
 * 3`
 * seconds.
 * 
 * **Example 2:**
 * 
 * **Input:** mountainHeight = 10, workerTimes = [3,2,2,4]
 * 
 * **Output:** 12
 * 
 * **Explanation:**
 * 
 * * Worker 0 reduces the height by 2, taking `workerTimes[0] + workerTimes[0]
 * * 2 = 9` seconds.
 * * Worker 1 reduces the height by 3, taking `workerTimes[1] + workerTimes[1]
 * * 2 + workerTimes[1] * 3 = 12` seconds.
 * * Worker 2 reduces the height by 3, taking `workerTimes[2] + workerTimes[2]
 * * 2 + workerTimes[2] * 3 = 12` seconds.
 * * Worker 3 reduces the height by 2, taking `workerTimes[3] + workerTimes[3]
 * * 2 = 12` seconds.
 * 
 * The number of seconds needed is `max(9, 12, 12, 12) = 12` seconds.
 * 
 * **Example 3:**
 * 
 * **Input:** mountainHeight = 5, workerTimes = [1]
 * 
 * **Output:** 15
 * 
 * **Explanation:**
 * 
 * There is only one worker in this example, so the answer is `workerTimes[0] +
 * workerTimes[0] * 2 + workerTimes[0] * 3 + workerTimes[0] * 4 +
 * workerTimes[0] *
 * 5 = 15`.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * **Constraints:**
 * 
 *   * `1 <= mountainHeight <= 105`
 *   * `1 <= workerTimes.length <= 104`
 *   * `1 <= workerTimes[i] <= 106`
 *
