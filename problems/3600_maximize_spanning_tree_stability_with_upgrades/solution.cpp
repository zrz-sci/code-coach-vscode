 * LeetCode Problem 3600: Maximize Spanning Tree Stability with Upgrades
 * Difficulty: Hard
 * Tags: Greedy, Union Find, Graph, Binary Search, Minimum Spanning Tree
 *
 * Problem Description:
 * You are given an integer `n`, representing `n` nodes numbered from 0 to `n
 * - 1`
 * and a list of `edges`, where `edges[i] = [ui, vi, si, musti]`:
 * 
 *   * `ui` and `vi` indicates an undirected edge between nodes `ui` and `vi`.
 *   * `si` is the strength of the edge.
 * * `musti` is an integer (0 or 1). If `musti == 1`, the edge **must** be
 * included in the******spanning tree**. These edges **cannot** be
 * **upgraded**.
 * 
 * You are also given an integer `k`, the **maximum** number of upgrades you
 * can
 * perform. Each upgrade **doubles** the strength of an edge, and each eligible
 * edge (with `musti == 0`) can be upgraded **at most** once.
 * 
 * The **stability** of a spanning tree is defined as the **minimum** strength
 * score among all edges included in it.
 * 
 * Return the **maximum** possible stability of any valid spanning tree. If it
 * is
 * impossible to connect all nodes, return `-1`.
 * 
 * **Note** : A **spanning tree** of a graph with `n` nodes is a subset of the
 * edges that connects all nodes together (i.e. the graph is **connected**)
 * _without_ forming any cycles, and uses **exactly** `n - 1` edges.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * **Example 1:**
 * 
 * **Input:** n = 3, edges = [[0,1,2,1],[1,2,3,0]], k = 1
 * 
 * **Output:** 2
 * 
 * **Explanation:**
 * 
 *   * Edge `[0,1]` with strength = 2 must be included in the spanning tree.
 * * Edge `[1,2]` is optional and can be upgraded from 3 to 6 using one
 * upgrade.
 * * The resulting spanning tree includes these two edges with strengths 2 and
 * 6.
 * * The minimum strength in the spanning tree is 2, which is the maximum
 * possible stability.
 * 
 * **Example 2:**
 * 
 * **Input:** n = 3, edges = [[0,1,4,0],[1,2,3,0],[0,2,1,0]], k = 2
 * 
 * **Output:** 6
 * 
 * **Explanation:**
 * 
 *   * Since all edges are optional and up to `k = 2` upgrades are allowed.
 *   * Upgrade edges `[0,1]` from 4 to 8 and `[1,2]` from 3 to 6.
 * * The resulting spanning tree includes these two edges with strengths 8 and
 * 6.
 * * The minimum strength in the tree is 6, which is the maximum possible
 * stability.
 * 
 * **Example 3:**
 * 
 * **Input:** n = 3, edges = [[0,1,1,1],[1,2,1,1],[2,0,1,1]], k = 0
 * 
 * **Output:** -1
 * 
 * **Explanation:**
 * 
 * * All edges are mandatory and form a cycle, which violates the spanning
 * tree property of acyclicity. Thus, the answer is -1.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * **Constraints:**
 * 
 *   * `2 <= n <= 105`
 *   * `1 <= edges.length <= 105`
 *   * `edges[i] = [ui, vi, si, musti]`
 *   * `0 <= ui, vi < n`
 *   * `ui != vi`
 *   * `1 <= si <= 105`
 *   * `musti` is either `0` or `1`.
 *   * `0 <= k <= n`
 *   * There are no duplicate edges.
