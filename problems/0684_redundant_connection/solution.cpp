 * LeetCode Problem 684: Redundant Connection
 * Difficulty: Medium
 * Tags: Depth-First Search, Breadth-First Search, Union Find, Graph
 *
 * Problem Description:
 * In this problem, a tree is an **undirected graph** that is connected and
 * has no
 * cycles.
 * 
 * You are given a graph that started as a tree with `n` nodes labeled from
 * `1` to
 * `n`, with one additional edge added. The added edge has two **different**
 * vertices chosen from `1` to `n`, and was not an edge that already existed.
 * The
 * graph is represented as an array `edges` of length `n` where `edges[i] =
 * [ai,
 * bi]` indicates that there is an edge between nodes `ai` and `bi` in the
 * graph.
 * 
 * Return _an edge that can be removed so that the resulting graph is a tree
 * of_`n`
 * _nodes_. If there are multiple answers, return the answer that occurs last
 * in
 * the input.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * **Example 1:**
 * 
 *     
 *     
 *     **Input:** edges = [[1,2],[1,3],[2,3]]
 *     **Output:** [2,3]
 *     
 * 
 * **Example 2:**
 * 
 *     
 *     
 *     **Input:** edges = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[1,4],[1,5]]
 *     **Output:** [1,4]
 *     
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * **Constraints:**
 * 
 *   * `n == edges.length`
 *   * `3 <= n <= 1000`
 *   * `edges[i].length == 2`
 *   * `1 <= ai < bi <= edges.length`
 *   * `ai != bi`
 *   * There are no repeated edges.
 *   * The given graph is connected.
